== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display the thingviewer? =

Before all you have to load into the media of your Wordpress the STL file of the 3D model you want to display.
After that you can use the shortcode to display the thingviewer into your pages or posts.

The plugin provide a shortcode generator button into Classic Editor and Gutenberg.

This is the shortcode manual use:

`[wp-3dtvl model_file="http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/case.stl"][/wp-3dtvl]`

The parameters are the following

* model_file: specify the model file URL to display.

The plugin display a thingviewer that load the selected STL file and let you interact with this.
The thingviewer is always resized at the width of the parent element.
The height will be calculated to display the thingviewer in a 16:9 ratio.

You can display a preview image instead of the Thingviewer at page load.

This is the shortcode with the preview image:

`[wp-3dtvl model_file="http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/case.stl" model_preview="http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/preview_image.jpg"][/wp-3dtvl]`

If your 3d model is displayed in a incorrect rotation, you can rotate the model on loading, by specifying the rotation values on X, Y, and Z axis in the shortcode.
This is the usage:

`[wp-3dtvl model_file="http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/case.stl" rotation_x=20 rotation_y=30][/wp-3dtvl]`

In this example the model will be rotated by 20 degrees on the X axis, by 30 degrees on the Y axis and by 0 degrees on the Z axis.
